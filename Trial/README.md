This is a handbook to enable our services partners in landing SMB-SMC Azure customers. 

 

We curated a list of easy-to-adopt Azure workloads and their use-cases which can be powerful conversation starters for our partners to land new customers easily. There are talking points which highlight the value proposition of each service.  

We have been maintaining this handbook for 6+ months now and the work has been appreciated both internally and externally. Our Partner Lead has been actively using it in partner coaching and has found the content to be of great help. Our partners have also found this content very useful. 

Because of the positive feedback, we want to make this handbook available for everyone, so that our partners across regions can take advantage of this in an effort to land more customers. We will continue to update this document as we discover new Azure Services, workloads and feedback.
